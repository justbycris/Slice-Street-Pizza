# Slice-Street-Pizza
This is a fun project I designed and developed with HTML, CSS, and ReactJS, based on a fictional pizza restaurant. 

# Concept Design & Colors
I wanted the concept design to be a fun, friendly, and uniquely bold restaurant. Decided to incorporate a bold colors, that would contrast well with black (one of my favorites) and choosing the red due to relation with tomato sauce as well as to transmit appetite with psychology of color. 

# Fonts
The font family selected, 'Righteous', for my titles represents the fun and unique style while also having a slightl touch of space theme. I selected then the family for paragraphs, 'Lucida Sans', which is highly readable due to its large height and hence gets the message clear and direct, while having a characteristic look for a sans-serif font. 

# Graphics
To create personality, I wanted it to have fun, organic, and strong illustrations. The homepage pizza illustration represents this in the best way. There is something I love about not too perfect illustration because they transmit a more fun and and 'adventurous' visual message. That is welcoming to all types of interpretation, taste, and styles.
